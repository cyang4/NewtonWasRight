    narrator "Eve Rosborough could dimly hear the pattering of rain against her bedroom window and instinctively curled up tighter in her cocoon of blankets."
    narrator "It was a losing battle, though, as she knew all too well. "
    narrator "Within a few minutes, she succumbed to waking and slid from her bed, indulging in a big yawn before glaring at the gloomy day for being so gloomy."

    narrator "She was supposed to work on the treehouse with her dad today, but the weather would definitely act as an excuse for him.{w} She'd been bugging him for weeks, but he always managed to find a way out of it."
    narrator "Last time, he was apparently worried about the end of the world or some weird thing like that."

    narrator "Aside from the rather dreary exterior, it was about 99\% impossible for there to have been an apocalypse on that day.{w} The trees were quite alive, her room was perfectly organized using her methodical categorization technique (which will be covered shortly), and her bane of a laptop was on. "
    narrator "In fact, there was a new message waiting for her on the new messaging client she'd been using for the past few days.{w} It was strange - instead of any way to add buddies, she could only press the blue \"chat\" button and randomly encounter someone.{w} More often than not, they wrote in languages she couldn't understand, most likely since she could only speak English and, well, the rest of the world had many more interesting and beautiful languages to offer."
    narrator "Not that she hated English. She just hated language in general. It was so...{w} constraining, unlike {i}doing{/i}."

    narrator "Eve picked her way out of her mess of bedding and set both feet on the hardwood floor at once.{w} It was a long-held tradition for her.{w} She found that if she neglected the simple ritual, she would most likely begin a chain of increasingly paranoid activities that led to panic attacks."
    narrator "Her bed was a standard-issue, twin-sized wooden box with a mattress thrown on top. Her sheets were a similarly dull light blue. She'd moved it to the far corner of her room so that she could never be sneaked up on, a good practice in her opinion."
    narrator "The rest of her room was a bit different.{w} Her walls were lined with white-boards, all of which were to be wiped clean before she went to sleep.{w} Sleeping with such textual noise would be so...{w} stressful.{w} No, she made sure to transfer her thoughts into blueprints long before she performed her pre-bedtime rituals."
    narrator "Besides the white-boards, she only had a desk lining the wall adjoining the door, and a row of filing cabinets next to her bed.{w} Chairs were strenuously unnecessary. After all, she was more often on her feet or asleep than sitting."
    nvl clear
    narrator "She padded over to the desk, cringing at how cold the floorboards were and silently scolding herself about not being able to stand carpet."
    narrator "Apparently, someone had been messaging her nonstop."

    narrator "-- {color=#004000}{b}Narcissus{/b}{/color} began chatting with {color=#000040}{b}Daedalus{/b}{/color}. --"
    narcissus "Oh, please let you be English."
    narcissus "I'm not sure how to begin."
    narcissus "Hello?"
    narcissus "Well, assuming you are still asleep and your laptop miraculously turned on like my unfortunate circumstance, I will copy and paste my situation and hope very hard that you speak my language."
    narcissus "O fair maiden, I have been thrown into a very unfortunate circumstance and I seek your help. You see, I awoke on this very stormy morn with no premonition of what I was about to find. You see, nobody seems to exist anymore. I fear that I may be the only one left after a most treacherous kidnapping. I have spent a good deal of time calling to my parents, but to no avail. Then I tried the hall of my apartment. They were gone, their room empty. Void of life. O it is most dreadful!"
    nvl clear
    narcissus "But what is more, I believe that I am forever trapped in this nightmarish hell. The doors are gone."
    narcissus "HELLO?"
    narcissus "Please, if you are a fair sir, please don't be insulted by my assumption of your sex. I beg of you, respond!"
    daedalus "Je mange le singe pisse."
    narcissus "O I condemn you to a thousand deaths by the sun!"
    daedalus "Avoir bonne journee."
    narcissus "You foul French-speaking bastard, do not falsify your origins unto me! I have studied this most romantic language to fabulous extremes, and your poor usage makes my heart quiver in pain."
    daedalus "我要烧你的牛。"
    narcissus "You artless idle-minded lout! I am now most certain you speak my language."
    nvl clear
    narcissus "Hello?"
    narcissus "Please reply... You may be the only one left."
    narrator "-- {color=#000040}{b}Daedalus{/b}{/color} has logged off. --"

    narrator "That chap did seem quite off his rocker."
    narrator "Oh no.{w} She was starting to think like he spoke.{w} Or typed."
    narrator "He probably was a bit mentally unstable. She definitely had...{w} a...{w} door?{w} No, in the place of the door, there was only a door frame.{w} Strange, although the change in decor certainly wasn't in bad taste. She {i}would{/i} have to worry about excess sound when she went to bed."
    nvl clear
    narrator "Oddly enough, her parents didn't seem to be home.{w} They might have gone out again to buy groceries.{w} Not that they needed all that much.{w} In their small apartment, they had two full refrigerators."
    narrator "Two.{p}Full.{p}Fridges."
    narrator "She directed herself to one such fridge and pulled out a carton of orange juice."
    narrator "And then she noticed."
    narrator "The doormat was there, but in the place of the main entrance door was a stretch of white wall."
