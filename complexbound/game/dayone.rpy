    narrator "Eve Rosborough could dimly hear the pattering of rain against her bedroom window and instinctively curled up tighter in her cocoon of blankets."
    narrator "It was a losing battle, though, as she knew all too well. "
    narrator "Within a few minutes, she succumbed to waking and slid from her bed, indulging in a big yawn before glaring at the gloomy day for being so gloomy."

    narrator "She was supposed to work on the treehouse with her dad today, but the weather would definitely act as an excuse for him.{w} She'd been bugging him for weeks, but he always managed to find a way out of it."
    narrator "Last time, he was apparently worried about the end of the world or some weird thing like that."
    nvl clear
    narrator "Aside from the rather dreary exterior, it was about 99\% impossible for there to have been an apocalypse on that day.{w} The trees were quite alive, her room was perfectly organized using her methodical categorization technique (which will be covered shortly), and her bane of a laptop was on. "
    narrator "In fact, there was a new message waiting for her on the new messaging client she'd been using for the past few days.{w} It was strange - instead of any way to add buddies, she could only press the blue \"chat\" button and randomly encounter someone.{w} More often than not, they wrote in languages she couldn't understand, most likely since she could only speak English and, well, the rest of the world had many more interesting and beautiful languages to offer."
    narrator "Not that she hated English. She just hated language in general. It was so...{w} constraining, unlike {i}doing{/i}."

    narrator "Eve picked her way out of her mess of bedding and set both feet on the hardwood floor at once.{w} It was a long-held tradition for her.{w} She found that if she neglected the simple ritual, she would most likely begin a chain of increasingly paranoid activities that led to panic attacks."
    narrator "Her bed was a standard-issue, twin-sized wooden box with a mattress thrown on top. Her sheets were a similarly dull light blue. She'd moved it to the far corner of her room so that she could never be sneaked up on, a good practice in her opinion."
    narrator "The rest of her room was a bit different.{w} Her walls were lined with white-boards, all of which were to be wiped clean before she went to sleep.{w} Sleeping with such textual noise would be so...{w} stressful.{w} No, she made sure to transfer her thoughts into blueprints long before she performed her pre-bedtime rituals."
    narrator "Besides the white-boards, she only had a desk lining the wall adjoining the door, and a row of filing cabinets next to her bed.{w} Chairs were strenuously unnecessary. After all, she was more often on her feet or asleep than sitting."
    nvl clear
    narrator "She padded over to the desk, cringing at how cold the floorboards were and silently scolding herself about not being able to stand carpet."
    narrator "Apparently, someone had been messaging her nonstop."

    narcissus "I'm not sure how to begin."
    narcissus "Hello?"
    narcissus "Well, assuming you are still asleep and your laptop miraculously turned on like my unfortunate circumstance, I will copy and paste my situation and hope very hard that you speak my language."
    narcissus "O fair maiden, I have been thrown into a very unfortunate circumstance and I seek your help. You see, I awoke on this very stormy morn with no premonition of what I was about to find. You see, nobody seems to exist anymore. I fear that I may be the only one left after a most treacherous kidnapping. I have spent a good deal of time calling for my parents, but to no avail. Then I tried the hall of my apartment. They were gone, their room empty. Void of life. O it is most dreadful!"

    narcissus "But what is more, I believe that I am forever trapped in this nightmarish hell. The doors are gone."

    daedalus "Je mange le singe pisse."
    narcissus "O I condemn you to a thousand deaths by the sun!"
    daedalus "Avoir bonne journee."
    narcissus "You foul French-speaking bastard, do not falsify your origins unto me! I have studied this most romantic language to fabulous extremes, and your poor usage makes my heart quiver in pain."
    daedalus "我要烧你的牛。"
    narcissus "You artless idle-minded lout! I am now most certain you speak my language."

    narrator "He probably was a bit mentally unstable. She definitely had...{w} a...{w} door?{w} No, in the place of the door, there was only a door frame.{w} Strange, although the change in decor certainly wasn't in bad taste.

    narrator "She directed herself to one such fridge and pulled out a carton of orange juice."
    narrator "And then she noticed."
    narrator "The doormat was there, but in the place of the main entrance door was a stretch of white wall."

    scene rooftop with fade
    narrator "Kentin Banister disliked sleeping."
    narrator "Actually, he didn't really dislike it.{w} He just found explosives much, {i}much{/i} more interesting.{w} Of course, his dearest parental figures would never allow him to be near any explosives apart from fireworks.{w} Nor did they know of his obsession with explosives. They simply thought of it as his way of trying to inherit the family company, something that would most certainly happen."
    narrator "Thankfully for him (although most likely not for the rest of the world), they never even considered him to potentially be a pyromaniac.{w} Not their dear, sweet, precious son."
    nvl clear
    narrator "Instead of sleeping, he would typically stay up late on the roof of their apartment complex, setting off fireworks at odd hours so nobody would look outside and wonder what he was doing and possibly get him arrested.{w} Unfortunately, like any human, he would eventually fail at avoiding the necessity called sleep.{w} In fact, it wasn't exactly uncommon for him to do so, which was why he woke up on the roof without any surprise."
    narrator "It was raining, one of his least favorite weathers due to it limiting his ability to explode things. Plus, he was now soaking wet, another one of his pet peeves. At least his waterproof bag would protect the remaining fireworks."
    narrator "Groaning in vague irritation, he grabbed the manpurse and trudged back through the doorway.{w} Oddly enough, the door was gone. Maybe someone decided to steal all the doors in the building last night.{w} It didn't really matter to him."

    scene kentinRoom with dissolve
    narrator "He walked into his suite and discovered nobody was inside. Not that that was surprising.{w} His parents were probably out, although being gone this early was...{w} slightly concerning."
    narrator "Kentin threw his bag on the creaky floorboards of his room and changed into dry clothes.{w} As for his still-soaked hair... well, he never bothered with it, anyway. It was always messy, unless his overly happy mother decided he needed to look nice for this cousin's wedding, or that uncle's best friend's funeral, or whatever."
    narrator "Sighing, he went to the ever-so-cold kitchen through the doorless doorway, grabbed some leftover pizza from dinner the night before, nuked it, and strolled to his bedroom window as he ate it.{w} Being on the top floor of a thirteen-story apartment complex had some advantages, like seeing the wondrous city laid out all before you, or getting easy access to the roof."
    nvl clear
    narrator "A few minutes later, he gave up on watching the city and instead decided to check his laptop for any messages.{w} Recently, he had installed (or rather, it had spontaneously appeared on his laptop) an odd chatting client that basically allowed him to encounter random other individuals, most of which didn't speak English. If they did, however, they would typically bother him with useless things or ask him pointless questions.{w} Even so, he enjoyed entertaining himself with overthinking the simple questions and acting philosophical. Or, perhaps, giving an answer even more pig-brained than the question."
    narrator "Nobody had started a conversation with him during the hours he'd been on the roof, ubiquitous hum of the laptop's fan echoing through the empty room. Rain pattered rhythmically on his window as he pressed the blue button."
